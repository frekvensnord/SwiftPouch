// MARK: - Host hooks for sandboxing
//
// SwiftScript runs against `ShellKit.Shell.current` so embedders can
// confine script I/O without forking the bridge generator. The
// auto-generated Foundation bridges (FileManager, URLSession,
// ProcessInfo) and the hand-rolled ones (`String.write(to:)`,
// `Data(contentsOf:)`, …) call into these top-level functions before
// touching disk / network / identity.
//
// Default behaviour: each gate reads from
// ``ShellKit/Shell/current``. An embedder that wants confinement just
// constructs a ``ShellKit/Shell`` with a `sandbox` / `networkConfig`
// / `hostInfo` and binds it via ``ShellKit/Shell/withCurrent(_:)``.
// Standalone (`swift-script` CLI) sees ``ShellKit/Shell/processDefault``
// — `nil` sandbox, no network policy, real `HostInfo` — so the gates
// are no-ops and the binary behaves as it always did.

/// kind to apply different rules per intent (e.g. allow read-only
/// access to system frameworks but deny writes).

/// the host process CWD, and — under a sandbox that carries a
/// ``ShellKit/PathMapping`` — the virtual spelling translates to the
/// host directory that backs it. The *host* form is what gets
/// authorized and what comes back.
///
/// The return value is deliberately not discardable: authorizing the
/// translated path while the Foundation call consumes the literal
/// spelling (or vice versa) is a sandbox escape — the check would
/// pass against the mapped host space while the I/O touches the
/// host's own `/tmp/x`. Whoever authorizes must also consume.
